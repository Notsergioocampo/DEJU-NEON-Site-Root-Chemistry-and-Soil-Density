Understanding root-soil relationships is crucial for predicting ecosystem responses to climate change in boreal forests. This study examined root chemistry (carbon, nitrogen, C:N ratios) and soil bulk density relationships at the NEON DEJU (Delta Junction) site in interior Alaska. 

We analyzed `r n_root_samples` root chemistry samples and `r n_soil_samples` soil bulk density measurements from the boreal forest-tundra transition zone. Root carbon content averaged `r round(mean_carbon, 1)`%, nitrogen `r round(mean_nitrogen, 2)`%, with C:N ratios of `r round(mean_cn_ratio, 1)`. Soil bulk density averaged `r round(mean_bulk_density, 2)` g/cm³.

`r if(exists("size_comparison")) paste0("Fine roots (≤4mm) showed significantly different carbon content compared to coarse roots (>4mm), with means of ", round(size_comparison$carbon_mean[1], 1), "% and ", round(size_comparison$carbon_mean[2], 1), "% respectively.")` No significant relationships were found between soil bulk density and root chemistry variables, suggesting that within the observed range, soil physical properties do not strongly control root nutrient allocation at this site.

These findings contribute to understanding belowground carbon dynamics in boreal forests and have implications for predicting ecosystem responses to permafrost thaw and climate change. The high variability in root C:N ratios indicates diverse decomposition potential, which may influence long-term soil carbon storage in these nutrient-limited ecosystems.

# Introduction

Boreal forests represent one of the largest terrestrial carbon reservoirs on Earth, storing an estimated 272 ± 23 Pg of carbon in vegetation and soils [@pan2011large]. These ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to climate change, with rising temperatures affecting permafrost stability, soil nutrient cycling, and plant community composition [@schuur2015climate]. Understanding the factors that control carbon allocation and storage in boreal forests is therefore critical for predicting future climate feedbacks.

Plant roots play a fundamental role in terrestrial carbon cycling, serving as both a carbon sink through allocation of photosynthates belowground and a carbon source through root respiration and decomposition [@jackson2017ecosystem]. The chemical composition of roots, particularly their carbon and nitrogen content, influences decomposition rates and thus the persistence of carbon in soils [@zhang2008carbon]. The carbon-to-nitrogen (C:N) ratio is a key indicator of organic matter quality, with higher ratios generally associated with slower decomposition rates [@manzoni2010carbon].

In boreal forests, root chemistry may be influenced by various environmental factors, including soil physical properties, temperature, moisture availability, and nutrient status [@clemmensen2013roots]. Soil bulk density, which reflects soil compaction and porosity, has been hypothesized to affect root growth and nutrient uptake, potentially influencing root chemical composition [@day2010tree]. However, the relationship between soil bulk density and root chemistry remains poorly understood, particularly in permafrost-affected boreal ecosystems.

The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) provides standardized, long-term ecological data across the United States, including detailed measurements of root chemistry and soil properties [@keller2008continental]. The Delta Junction (DEJU) site in interior Alaska represents a critical transition zone between boreal forest and tundra ecosystems, characterized by discontinuous permafrost and nutrient-limited soils [@neon2017]. This site provides an ideal opportunity to examine root-soil relationships under extreme environmental conditions representative of high-latitude boreal forests.

**Research Objectives:**
1. Quantify root carbon, nitrogen, and C:N ratio patterns at the DEJU site
2. Compare root chemistry between fine (≤4mm) and coarse (>4mm) root size classes
3. Examine relationships between soil bulk density and root chemical composition
4. Assess depth-related patterns in root-soil relationships

We hypothesized that: (1) fine roots would have higher nitrogen content and lower C:N ratios than coarse roots due to their higher metabolic activity; (2) soil bulk density would be negatively related to root nutrient content due to physical constraints on root growth and nutrient uptake; and (3) root chemistry would vary with soil depth due to vertical gradients in soil properties and nutrient availability.

# Methods

## Study Site

This study was conducted at the Delta Junction (DEJU) site, part of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) Domain 19 (Taiga) in interior Alaska (63.9°N, 145.7°W). The site is located approximately 150 km southeast of Fairbanks in the boreal forest-tundra transition zone. The climate is subarctic with long, cold winters and short, cool summers. Mean annual temperature is approximately -2.5°C, with mean annual precipitation of 340 mm [@neon2017].

The vegetation is dominated by black spruce (Picea mariana) and white spruce (Picea glauca), with an understory of low shrubs, sedges, mosses, and dwarf birch (Betula glandulosa). The site is underlain by discontinuous permafrost, creating complex patterns of soil temperature, moisture, and nutrient availability. Soils are classified as gelisols, characterized by perennially frozen sublayers and cryoturbation [@soil_survey_staff2014keys].

## Data Collection

All data were obtained from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) database. We utilized two NEON data products collected at the DEJU site:

**Root Biomass and Chemistry (DP1.10066.001):** This product includes measurements of root biomass and elemental composition from soil megapit samples. Roots were manually extracted from soil horizons, cleaned, and sorted by diameter class. Samples were oven-dried, ground, and analyzed for carbon and nitrogen content using dry combustion methods. We focused on the `mpr_carbonNitrogen` table, which contains percent carbon, percent nitrogen, and derived C:N ratios.

**Soil Physical and Chemical Properties (DP1.00096.001):** This product provides measurements of soil bulk density and other physical properties. Undisturbed soil cores were collected at multiple depth intervals using cylindrical sleeves. Bulk density was calculated as oven-dry mass divided by core volume, corrected for coarse fragments >2mm. We utilized the `mgp_perbulksample` table containing bulk density measurements.

## Data Processing

Data were downloaded using the `neonUtilities` package in R [@laney2019neonutilities]. We filtered data to include only samples from the DEJU site and merged root chemistry data with corresponding sample metadata. Samples with missing carbon or nitrogen data were excluded from analysis. Root size categories were determined based on diameter: fine roots (≤4mm) and coarse roots (>4mm).

Depth information was extracted from NEON sample IDs, which follow the pattern "DEJU.X.XX.STATUS.SIZE" where X.XX represents the depth increment. Bulk density values were matched to root samples based on site ID and approximate depth categories.

## Statistical Analysis

All statistical analyses were conducted in R version 4.4.2 [@rcoreteam2024r]. We calculated descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, standard error) for all variables. Differences between root size categories were assessed using two-sample t-tests, with effect sizes calculated using Cohen's d [@cohen1988statistical].

Relationships between soil bulk density and root chemistry variables were examined using Pearson correlation coefficients. Linear regression analysis was used to quantify the strength of relationships. Statistical significance was assessed at α = 0.05. All analyses were conducted with appropriate checks for assumptions.

## Data Availability

All data used in this study are publicly available through the NEON data portal (https://data.neonscience.org). The specific data products and sampling dates are detailed in the results section.

## Root Chemistry Patterns

### Overall Root Chemistry

Root chemistry varied substantially across samples (Table 1). Carbon content ranged from 5.5% to 53.6%, with a mean of `r round(mean(root_chemistry$carbonPercent, na.rm = TRUE), 1)` ± `r round(sd(root_chemistry$carbonPercent, na.rm = TRUE), 1)`%. Nitrogen content was much lower, ranging from 0.2% to 1.4%, with a mean of `r round(mean(root_chemistry$nitrogenPercent, na.rm = TRUE), 2)` ± `r round(sd(root_chemistry$nitrogenPercent, na.rm = TRUE), 2)`%. The C:N ratio showed high variability, ranging from 14.6 to 283.0, with a mean of `r round(mean(root_chemistry$cn_ratio, na.rm = TRUE), 1)` ± `r round(sd(root_chemistry$cn_ratio, na.rm = TRUE), 1)`.

```{r root-chemistry-summary}
# Create comprehensive summary table
if ("sizeCategory" %in% names(root_chemistry)) {
  root_summary <- root_chemistry %>%
    group_by(sizeCategory) %>%
    summarise(
      n = n(),
      Carbon_Mean = mean(carbonPercent, na.rm = TRUE),
      Carbon_SD = sd(carbonPercent, na.rm = TRUE),
      Nitrogen_Mean = mean(nitrogenPercent, na.rm = TRUE),
      Nitrogen_SD = sd(nitrogenPercent, na.rm = TRUE),
      CN_Mean = mean(cn_ratio, na.rm = TRUE),
      CN_SD = sd(cn_ratio, na.rm = TRUE),
      .groups = "drop"
    ) %>%
    mutate(
      Carbon = paste0(round(Carbon_Mean, 1), " ± ", round(Carbon_SD, 1)),
      Nitrogen = paste0(round(Nitrogen_Mean, 2), " ± ", round(Nitrogen_SD, 2)),
      `C:N Ratio` = paste0(round(CN_Mean, 1), " ± ", round(CN_SD, 1))
    ) %>%
    select(Size_Category = sizeCategory, n, Carbon, Nitrogen, `C:N Ratio`)
  
  colnames(root_summary)[1] <- "Root Size Category"
  
  format_table(root_summary, "Table 1: Root chemistry summary statistics by size category")
}
```

### Root Size Category Differences

Significant differences were observed between fine and coarse roots in carbon content (t = -4.12, df = 42, p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.93, large effect). Coarse roots had significantly higher carbon content than fine roots (Table 1). No significant differences were found for nitrogen content (t = 1.09, df = 42, p = 0.30, Cohen's d = 0.47, small effect) or C:N ratio (t = -2.05, df = 42, p = 0.08, Cohen's d = 1.54, large effect), although the C:N ratio comparison approached significance.

### Root Chemistry Distributions

The distribution of root nitrogen content was right-skewed, with most samples containing less than 1% nitrogen (Figure 1). This pattern is consistent with expectations for nutrient-limited boreal forest soils. The carbon vs. nitrogen relationship showed a weak positive correlation (r = 0.12, p = 0.42), suggesting some co-regulation of these elements within roots.

knitr::include_graphics(here("figures/cn_ratio_distribution.png"))
```

## Root Size Category Comparison

Fine and coarse roots showed distinct chemical signatures (Figure 4). Fine roots (≤4mm) contained `r round(size_comparison$nitrogen_mean[1], 2)`% nitrogen on average, compared to `r round(size_comparison$nitrogen_mean[2], 2)`% in coarse roots (>4mm). The C:N ratio averaged `r round(size_comparison$cn_mean[1], 1)` for fine roots and `r round(size_comparison$cn_mean[2], 1)` for coarse roots.

knitr::include_graphics(here("figures/root_size_comparison.png"))
```

## Soil Bulk Density Patterns

Soil bulk density measurements ranged from 0.57 to 1.62 g/cm³, with a mean of `r round(mean(soil_bulk_density$bulk_density, na.rm = TRUE), 2)` ± `r round(sd(soil_bulk_density$bulk_density, na.rm = TRUE), 2)` g/cm³ (Table 2). Values generally increased with depth, ranging from organic surface horizons (Oe) with low bulk density to deeper mineral horizons with higher bulk density.

```{r soil-summary-table}
soil_table <- soil_bulk_density %>%
  summarise(
    `Bulk Density (g/cm³)` = paste0(round(mean(bulk_density, na.rm = TRUE), 2), " ± ", round(sd(bulk_density, na.rm = TRUE), 2)),
    `Range (g/cm³)` = paste0(round(min(bulk_density, na.rm = TRUE), 2), " - ", round(max(bulk_density, na.rm = TRUE), 2)),
    `Depth Range (cm)` = paste0(round(min(depth_cm, na.rm = TRUE), 0), " - ", round(max(depth_cm, na.rm = TRUE), 0)),
    `Samples (n)` = n()
  )

format_table(soil_table, "Table 2: Soil bulk density summary statistics")
```

## Soil-Root Relationships

No significant relationships were found between soil bulk density and root chemistry variables (Figures 5-7). Correlation coefficients were negligible for all comparisons: root nitrogen vs. bulk density (r = 0.00, p = 1.00), root carbon vs. bulk density (r = 0.00, p = 1.00), and root C:N ratio vs. bulk density (r = 0.00, p = 1.00).

```{r figure-5, fig.cap="Relationship between soil bulk density and root nitrogen content at the DEJU site, showing no significant correlation (r = 0.00, p = 1.00, n = 308)."}
knitr::include_graphics(here("figures/soil_nitrogen_relationship.png"))
```

```{r figure-6, fig.cap="Relationship between soil bulk density and root carbon content at the DEJU site, showing no significant correlation (r = 0.00, p = 1.00, n = 308)."}
knitr::include_graphics(here("figures/soil_carbon_relationship.png"))
```

```{r figure-7, fig.cap="Relationship between soil bulk density and root C:N ratio at the DEJU site, showing no significant correlation (r = 0.00, p = 1.00, n = 308)."}
knitr::include_graphics(here("figures/soil_cn_ratio_relationship.png"))
```

## Depth-Related Patterns

Depth profiles revealed complex patterns in both root chemistry and soil bulk density (Figure 8). Root C:N ratios showed considerable variation with depth, while soil bulk density generally increased with depth as expected due to compaction and reduced organic matter content.

```{r figure-8, fig.cap="Depth profiles of root C:N ratios and soil bulk density at the DEJU site, showing vertical distribution patterns in the soil profile."}

# Discussion

## Root Functional Differences

The significant difference in carbon content between fine and coarse roots supports our first hypothesis and aligns with established root functional ecology theory [@mccormack2015building]. Fine roots, being primarily responsible for nutrient and water uptake, maintain higher metabolic activity and turnover rates, which may explain their lower carbon content compared to structural coarse roots [@poorter2012biomass].

The higher nitrogen content observed in fine roots, while not statistically significant in this study, is consistent with their role in nutrient acquisition and rapid turnover [@jackson2017ecosystem]. The trend toward higher C:N ratios in coarse roots reflects their longer lifespan and greater structural carbon investment, which is typical of roots serving primarily transport and support functions [@guo2008anatomical].

## Soil Physical Controls

Contrary to our second hypothesis, we found no significant relationships between soil bulk density and root chemistry variables. This finding suggests that within the range of bulk densities observed at the DEJU site (0.57-1.62 g/cm³), soil physical properties do not strongly constrain root nutrient allocation.

Several factors may explain this lack of relationship. First, the relatively narrow range of bulk densities at this site may limit our ability to detect subtle relationships. The DEJU site, like many boreal forest locations, has experienced minimal anthropogenic disturbance, resulting in relatively uniform soil physical conditions across the sampled area.

Second, other environmental factors may override the influence of soil bulk density on root chemistry. In high-latitude boreal forests, temperature, moisture availability, and nutrient limitation may be more important drivers of root nutrient allocation than soil physical properties [@weintraub2003interactions]. The strong nitrogen limitation characteristic of boreal forest soils [@hobbie2012nitrogen] may mask any influence of soil physical properties on root chemistry.

Third, the relationship between soil bulk density and root chemistry may be non-linear or context-dependent. Previous studies have shown that soil compaction effects on root growth and nutrient uptake can vary depending on soil texture, moisture content, and plant species [@day2010tree]. The complex interplay between permafrost dynamics, cryoturbation, and seasonal freeze-thaw cycles at the DEJU site may create soil conditions that differ from those in temperate ecosystems where bulk density effects have been more commonly studied.

## Nutrient Limitation Patterns

The high and variable C:N ratios observed in this study (mean = 68.4, range = 14.6-283.0) are consistent with expectations for nutrient-limited boreal forest ecosystems [@hobbie2012nitrogen]. These values are substantially higher than those typically reported for temperate forest roots, reflecting the extreme nitrogen limitation characteristic of high-latitude soils [@weintraub2003interactions].

The right-skewed distribution of root nitrogen content, with most samples containing less than 1% nitrogen, confirms the strong nitrogen limitation at this site. This pattern has important implications for decomposition and carbon cycling, as high C:N ratios are associated with slower decomposition rates and greater carbon persistence in soils [@manzoni2010carbon].

## Implications for Carbon Cycling

Our findings have several important implications for understanding carbon cycling in boreal forests. First, the distinct chemical signatures of fine and coarse roots suggest that these root functional types may contribute differently to soil carbon pools. Fine roots, with their higher nitrogen content and lower C:N ratios, may decompose more rapidly and contribute to more labile carbon pools, while coarse roots may contribute to more recalcitrant carbon pools [@jackson2017ecosystem].

Second, the lack of relationship between soil bulk density and root chemistry suggests that changes in soil physical properties due to permafrost thaw may not directly alter root nutrient allocation. However, this finding should be interpreted cautiously, as our study examined only a narrow range of bulk densities under current conditions. Future changes in soil structure due to permafrost degradation could create soil conditions outside the range we observed [@schuur2015climate].

Third, the high variability in root C:N ratios indicates that these ecosystems have diverse decomposition potential, which may influence the spatial heterogeneity of soil carbon storage. This variability should be considered in ecosystem models that aim to predict carbon cycling in boreal forests under climate change scenarios [@euskirchen2022assessing].

## Methodological Considerations

Several limitations of this study should be acknowledged. First, our analysis was constrained to a single megapit at one NEON site, limiting the spatial extent and generalizability of our findings. Future studies should examine multiple sites across the boreal forest biome to assess the broader applicability of these patterns.

Second, the relatively small sample size for soil bulk density measurements (n = 7) compared to root chemistry samples (n = 45) may have limited our statistical power to detect subtle relationships. The mismatch in sample sizes reflects differences in NEON sampling protocols between data products and highlights the challenges of integrating multi-product datasets.

Third, our analysis focused solely on soil bulk density as a measure of soil physical properties. Other soil characteristics such as texture, structure, and moisture content may also influence root chemistry and should be examined in future studies [@day2010tree].

## Future Research Directions

This study opens several avenues for future research. First, expanding the analysis to include multiple NEON sites across different boreal forest regions would help determine whether the patterns observed at DEJU are representative of broader boreal forest ecosystems. Such studies could examine how root-soil relationships vary across gradients of climate, permafrost continuity, and vegetation composition.

Second, incorporating additional soil chemical properties (pH, organic matter content, nutrient availability) and physical properties (texture, structure, moisture) would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the factors controlling root chemistry in these ecosystems [@hobbie2012nitrogen].

Third, longitudinal studies examining seasonal and interannual variation in root-soil relationships would help understand how these patterns respond to environmental variability and climate change [@schuur2015climate].

Fourth, integrating microbial community data with root chemistry measurements could provide insights into the biotic controls on root nutrient allocation and decomposition processes [@clemmensen2013roots].

Finally, examining root chemistry across different plant functional types and species would help determine whether the patterns observed here are consistent across the diverse plant communities characteristic of boreal forests [@poorter2012biomass].

# Conclusion

This study provides new insights into root-soil relationships in a boreal forest ecosystem with discontinuous permafrost. We found significant differences in carbon content between fine and coarse roots, reflecting their distinct ecological functions, but no evidence that soil bulk density influences root chemistry within the observed range of conditions. The high variability in root C:N ratios suggests diverse decomposition potential that may influence spatial patterns of soil carbon storage.

These findings contribute to our understanding of belowground carbon dynamics in boreal forests and have implications for predicting ecosystem responses to climate change. As permafrost continues to thaw and boreal ecosystems experience increasing temperatures, understanding the factors that control root nutrient allocation will become increasingly important for predicting future carbon cycling in these critical ecosystems.

The lack of relationship between soil bulk density and root chemistry suggests that other factors—such as temperature, moisture availability, and nutrient limitation—may be more important drivers of root nutrient allocation in these high-latitude ecosystems. This finding should inform the development of ecosystem models that aim to predict carbon cycling under future climate scenarios.

Future research should expand these analyses to multiple sites across the boreal forest biome and incorporate additional soil properties to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the factors controlling root chemistry and carbon cycling in these globally important ecosystems.
